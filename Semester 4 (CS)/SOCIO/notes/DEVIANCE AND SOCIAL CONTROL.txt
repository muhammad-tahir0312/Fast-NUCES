						==================== DEVIANCE AND SOCIAL CONTROL ====================


==> Coformity:
	It is a process by which people change their attitude, beliefs and actions to be fit in society or group of people.
		i.g: wearing certain type clothes to fit in the group
	. No culture or society has complete behavior conformity.
	. Deviance exist in all societies

==> Deviance:
	-> Deviance is a action which which is done by a society memeber and known as violation of society norm.
	-> The person who do deviant action likely to be punished.

==> How norms make social life possible:
	-> No human group can exist without norms because we can identify the behaviors of humans by norms of society.
	-> Norms lay out the basic guidelines for us that how to play our role in a society.
	-> Our lives are based on these arrangements.
	-> Consequently human groups developed a system of social control.
		- Formal and Informal (To enforce the norms)
	-> At the center of social control are sanctions.

==> Shifting Defination of Deviance:
	-> The act which thought as deviant in past but now it is not known as  deviant 
	-> Likely the act which was not known as deviant in past but now known as deviant.

==> Biological Explanations: 
	-> Sociobiologist explain deviance by looking for answers within individuals. They said that genetic predispositions lead people to such behaviors.
	-> People with "Squarish Muscular" bodies were more like to invlove in street crimes.
	-> These theories were abandoned when research did not support them.

==> Psychological Explanations:
	-> Psychologists focus on abnormalities with in the individual.
	-> Instead of genes they examine what are called personality disorder.
	-> Deviance is not associated with any perticular personality.

==> Sociological Explanations:
	-> In contrast with both socio-biologists and psychologists, sociologists search for factors outside the individual.
	-> They look for social influences that “recruit” people to break norms.
	-> To explain deviance sociologists apply the three sociological perspectives.
		1) Symbolic Interactionism
		2) Functionalism
		3) Conflict Theory
	
	1) Symbolic Interactionalism:
		The basic idea of symbolic interactionalism is that we are thinking that who act according to how we interpret the situations.
		::> DIFFERENTIAL ASSOCIATION THEORY:
			-> This theory says that person learn deviance from his family, friends or neighborhoods.
			-> If a person in prison then their is most prolly that his father, mother or other family member faced same situation.
			-> In short families which are invlovled in crime teach their children to break laws and regulations.
		
		::> CONTROL THEORY:
			-> Inner Controls: (Ideas of punishment, Ideas of right and wrong, religious principles).
			-> Outer Controls: (Family, friends and the police who influence us to not deviate).
		::> LABELING THEORY:
			-> The people who are given labels affect their own and others preception of them this can change their behavior into either deviance or conformity.
	
	2) Functionalism:
  		-> Can deviance really be functional for society?
		-> Emile Durkheim said that deviance can functional for societies in three ways.
			1) Deviance clarifies moral boundaries and affirms norms
			2) Deviance encourages social unity
			3) Deviance promotes social change
			
		::> Deviance clarifies moral boundaries and affirms norms:
			-> This refers that how people should think and act.
			-> If a person make and deviant act, call him punish him and say "you broke and important norm of society/group we cann't tolerate that." this will clarifies the means to be a member of the group.
		
		::> Deviance encourages social unity:
			-> By punishing deviants creates a "we" feeling among the group members. By saying that "you have to follow norms of society". The group affirms the rightness of it's ways.

		::> Deviance promotes social change:
			-> Some times deviance become new norm of a society.
			-> When a person do a deviance and got more support.
			-> It may force group or society to update their norms and circumstances.
	
	3) The Conflict Theory:
		-> This theory says that deviance is result of inequality in society.
		-> If a person with low power does a deviance work that he can be punished more strictly. meanwhile an elite person do not.

==> Social control leading to Sanctions
	-> A sanction is any reaction from others to the behavior of an individual or group. 
	-> Social sanctions encourage behaviors that are considered to be appropriate and stop from behaviors that are not. 
	-> These representative or typical patterns and rules of behavior are called social norms.

==> Two Types of Sanctions: 
	-> Negative Sanctions: (A expression of disapproval for braking a norm)
					i.g : getting fail in sociology.
	-> Positive Sanctions: (A expression of approval for following a norm)
					i.g: getting A+ in sociology.

==> Formal Vs Informal Sanctions:
	-> Formal Sanctions: that are officially made to force the people of sciety to follow the norms and regulations of a society.
	-> Informal Sanctions: that are not officially made by any authority to force the people of sciety to follow the norms and regulations of a society..

Social In-equality::>
	
. Differences according to wealth and resources in the same society
. Different access to education, income, judicial treatment

==> Four major systems of social stratification:

	1. Slavery: Some People own some other people to get work from them

		Causes of slavery: 
			-> Debt
			-> Crime
			-> War 

		Bonded Labor:
			Some people contract to work for other people with any salary for a specific number of years. It occurs due to unpaid debt of that man.

		Slavery In New World:
			1) Slavery has broad reasons so racism is not a cause of slavery But racism is becoming common due to slavery.
			2) Some people want to live a new life in America so they can't pay So they arrange for a ship captain to transport them on credit.
			3) With time, spending turned to Africans, who were being brought to North and South America by Dutch, English, Portuguese, and Spanish.
			
			--> In the US they made some arrangements for slaves and make them necessary and fair. To make Slavery more profitable they make some laws for slavery and that the new born babies will also be the property of owners of slaves & the black people were not allowed to sit in the same car.
			--> It comprises two elements. 
				1) Forced Labor
				2) Forced Marriages
					i.g: Child Sex Trafficking, Human Trafficking
			
		Slavery In Pakistan::>

	2. Caste: 
		The second system of Social Stratification is Caste and in this system Birth determines status.  
		-> Endogamey is a process in the caste system in which a member of a group can marriage within the same group and they prohibit marrying out of the same group.
		. India is the best example of a caste system, In India in 1994 the government of India removed this system but still some elements of this system are inherited from past practices, slowly in India, this system is replaced by a material wealth system.
		
		Caste System of India:

		Brahman     |  Priests and Teachers
		Kshatriya   |  Rulers and Soldiers
		Vaishya     |  Merchants and Traders
		Shudra 	    |  Peasants and Laborers
  (Untouchables)Dalit  	    |  The outcastes/ Degrading or polluting labor

		Caste System of Africa:
			Apartheid: The separation of the races approved and enforced by Government.
			-> Every one by law was classified into four Groups.
				1) Europeans (Whites)
				2) Africans (Blacks)
				3) Coloureds (Mixed Races)
				4) Asians
			    => These classifications determined that where could live, work and go to school.

			-> In 1994 Nelson Mandela a black was selected as president after it no black man have to keep special passs to entry public facility was integrated all people of all races have the right to give their vote and hold office.

	3. Estate:
		
		Estate stratification has divided further in to 3 classifications.
			
			1) Nobility :
				-> In this estate those people come who ruled the country they did not do any work by them self. 
				-> The nobility's responsibility was to administer their lands to defend their kings and their own positions.
				-> They enjoyed exclusive access to many government, religious, and military positions.

			2) Clergy :
				-> Roman catholic church was a political power at this time.
				-> It also owned vast amount of lands and collected taxes from all tjose people who lived in the boundries of parish.
				-> Church power was so great that king was also required to obtain permission from pops to do any thing.

			3) Commoners:

	4. Class:
		
		-> Class system based on money or material possessions, It also primarily base on income, education and prestige if occupation.
		-> Class system allows social mobility ( Movement up or down the class ladder).				 			
		=> Types Of Social Mobility:
			. Intergenerational mobility (The change that family members make in social class from one generation to the next).
			. Upward social mobility (Movement up the social class ladder)
			. Downward social mobility (Movement down the social class ladder)
			. Structural mobility (Movement up or down the social ladder that is due more to)

==>	Theoratical Perspective On Social Stratification:
		-> Karl Max
			::> If you own the means of production then you belong to bourgeoisie.
			::> If you do not own the means of production then you belong to proletariat.

==>  	False Class Consciousness:

		-> Wilbert Moore
			1) For Society to function, it's positions should must be filled.
			2) Some positions are more important than others.
			3) Important positions should be filled with qualified people.
			4) To motivate qualified people to fill these positions, they must offer greater rewards.

==> 	The Conflict Perspective: (Class Conflict and scarce Resourses)
		-> Gaetano Mosca
			1) No Society can run successfully unless it organized. And to oranize society it requires a leadership to coordinate.
			2) Leadership requires inequality in power. Like some people lead and some follow.
			3) People in power will use their positions to decide greater rewards for themselves.

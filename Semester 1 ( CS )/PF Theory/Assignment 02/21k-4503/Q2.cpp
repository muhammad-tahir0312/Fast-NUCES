a) If d is a float, then the operation d=2/7 would store _____ in d.
	
ANSWER OF a: 0.85714 ( becasue float take 4 bytes of memeory and show 7 digits.)

	
b) If x is an integer, then the expression x=-7%2-8 would evaluate to ______.

ANSWER OF b:	x = -7 % 2 -8
				x = -1 - 8
				x = -9
				

c) If c=0, then the expression 5&&c!=8||!c would evaluate to _____.
	
ANSWER OF c: 	5 && c !=8 || !c
         	 	5 && c !=8 || !c  ( TRUE )
[ BECAUSE "OR ||" operator return TRUE even ONE condition is true, in our case "5 && c !=8" AND "8||!=c" both are TRUE. ]       	

d) The expression a=b=c=3+4 would evaluate to: a=___, b=___, c=___.

ANSWER OF d; 	a=7 , b=7 and c=7


e)	The expression y=z=-3%-8/2+7 would evaluate to: y=_____, z=____.

ANSWER OF e:    y=z= -3 % -8 / 2 + 7
				y=z= -3 / 2 + 7 
				y=z= -1 + 7
				y=z= +6
				
         		y= 6 , z= 6
